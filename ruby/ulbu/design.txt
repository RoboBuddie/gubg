Design for ulbu
===============

# High-level design goals #

 * Syntax as close as possible to UML
 * Uncluttered usage
    * Implement main success scenario, treat deviations seperately
    * Have direct access to output of previous computations
    * Return multiple values
 * Minimalistic
    * No inheritance, only composition with automatic method resolving should do the trick
 * Fast
    * Compilation into assembly code
 * Low memory cost
    * Reference by default
 * Integrated build system
 * Check syntax and interpretability during compilation
    * Statically typed
 * As functional as possible
    * Closures
 * Scoped by default
    * Use RAII principle
       * Destructors
 * Multiple way to call a function (different arguments and types), but one function body
 * Templates?

# Allocate - initialize - processing - cleanup #

As a central philosophy, everything should be interpreted as space - initialize - processing - cleanup:
 * Function call:
    * Space for return values and local variables
    * Initialize local variables based on arguments and default values
    * Function body which calculates the return values
    * Remove local variables
    * Use the calculated outputs
    * Cleanup outputs when they are not needed anymore
 * Class:
    * Memory for class
    * Constructor
    * Methods
    * Destructor

# Nice to haves #

 * Close integration with Ruby

# Cota's #

 * Code and data are treated the same way, they are called _cota_'s.
    * Calling a cota is the same as its allocation

# Calling a cota #

 * Allocate space for the outputs on the stack
 * Allocate space for the inputs on the stack
 * Execute
 * Remove inputs
 * Other code that uses the outputs
 * Remove the outputs from the stack when they are not needed anymore

# Return values #

 * Calling a cota returns two different things
    * Execution status: null or a pointer to an exception cota
    * Computed outputs: the result of the call
