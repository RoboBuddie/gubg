# Todo for vix #
 * Loading folders and searching should be done in a thread, making sure vix remains responsive
 * Keep a cache of file content for faster searching
 * Instead of deleting files, move them to VIX_HOME and delete them only after a week or so
 * Files types and the actions for them should be loaded from a file, resorting to some default upon failure
 * vix should start in the current folder
 * Introduce a // search that will expand recursively immediately
 * Add file preview and allow syntax highlighting per file type
 * The file types that need content searching should be configurable
 * Create an installation package
 * Provide support for multiple actions on 1 file type (editing, building)
 * Provide support for copy-past and moving of files
 * Provide undo support for these types of actions
 * Create an icon
 * Allow vix to be resized, with or without border should be configurable
 * Create a help page
 * Allow content search on non-utf files
 * Provide support for page-up and page-down
 * Listen to WM events to refresh a bit faster
