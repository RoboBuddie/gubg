== Two-paned file browsers

A good file browser is one of the most important weapons a developer needs. My highly personal requirements are:
* Keyboard-based browsing with a minimal amount of keypresses
* Fast, even with lots of files and directories
* Opening files in different ways:
** Vim
** Default registered program
** Internal viewer is a bonus
* Easy to access

Here are some browsers that can make all the difference:

=== emlFM2
* tons of features, everything I need
* Fast
* http://emelfm2.net/wiki/UserGuide[User guide]

=== Proto
* Very nice concept, always available, tabbed and powerful
* Very accessible, <Alt>-~ is very close to <Alt>-<Tab>
* Filters files and directories that match whatever is typed, even if they match in the middle of a file
* WARNING: Only available on Windows

=== Xfe
* Seems nice and fast

=== Krusader
* Has all the features
* A bit slow
* KDE, and I happen to use Gnome. It works under Gnome, but e.g., the default app for a file is not the one from Gnome

=== Tux commander
* The default ubuntu crashes
* Needs fpc, the free pascal compiler
* Needs fp-units-gtk2, fp-units

=== Sunflower
* Crashes

=== muCommander
* To slow to use in practice, probably because its written in java
* Stalls from time to time, maybe due to garbage collection

=== Gnome commander
* Fails on my first requirement, merely typing does _not_ select a matching file or directory, but creates a CLI command. Or at least, I don't know how to configure it
* Look good and seems to provide a lot of features
