This software package implements a general function and neural network framework in combination with general mechanisms to perform serialization, network communication, statistics and visualization.

Currently, this software runs on a linux/gnu (kubuntu) system, but it should be portable to any platform that provides a sufficiently capable C++ compiler (and a few supporting libraries). It will run most probably only on a little endian architecture.
